# Wireless-Communications
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Wireless Communications course assignments, including computer assignments and the final presentation.

## Computer Assignment 1
- Part 1
  - Modeled and analyzed **path loss** and **shadowing** effects on received signal power.
  - Evaluated **SNR** variations with distance and environmental factors.
  - Assessed **outage probability** in a cellular network.
  - Compared theoretical and simulated **network coverage areas**.

- Part 2
  - Simulated **Rayleigh fading channels** with multipath propagation.
  - Examined **channel frequency response** over a specified bandwidth.

- Part 3
  - Computed and analyzed **average** and **RMS delay spread** in a given **power delay profile(PDP)**.

- Part 4:
  - Implemented **Gradient Ascent** for optimal **power allocation** in multi-user networks.
  - Evaluated **SINR** and its impact on network performance.


## Computer Assignment 2

- Part 1
  - Simulated Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) for a receiver with varying branches in a Rayleigh fading environment.
  - Plotted Bit Error Rate (BER) versus SNR for different branch numbers in 16-QAM modulation.
  - Compared performance for M=1, 2, 4, 8 branches and analyzed the impact of increasing diversity on BER.

- Part 2
  - Implemented time diversity by repeating symbols across multiple time slots.
  - Evaluated optimal decision-making for BPSK modulated symbols in terms of SNR.
  - Analyzed the error probability for various repetition factors and simulated the results for comparison.

- Part 3
  - Simulated space diversity with multiple antennas at the receiver using Alamouti coding.
  - Assessed the performance of the Alamouti scheme in terms of error probability under BPSK modulation.
  - Extended analysis to QPSK and 16-QAM modulations and compared the outcomes.
