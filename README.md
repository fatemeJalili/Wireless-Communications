  - Evaluated **SNR** variations with distance and environmental factors.
  - Assessed **outage probability** in a cellular network.
  - Compared theoretical and simulated **network coverage areas**.

- Part 2
  - Simulated **Rayleigh fading channels** with multipath propagation.
  - Examined **channel frequency response** over a specified bandwidth.

- Part 3
  - Computed and analyzed **average** and **RMS delay spread** in a given **power delay profile(PDP)**.

- Part 4
  - Implemented **Gradient Ascent** for optimal **power allocation** in multi-user networks.
  - Evaluated **SINR** and its impact on network performance.


## Computer Assignment 2

- Part 1
  - Simulated **Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC)** for a receiver with varying branches in a **Rayleigh fading** environment.
  - Plotted **Bit Error Rate (BER)** versus SNR for different branch numbers in **16-QAM** modulation.

- Part 2
  - Implemented **time diversity** by repeating symbols across multiple time slots.
  - Evaluated optimal **decision-making** for **BPSK** modulated symbols in terms of SNR.

- Part 3
  - Simulated **space diversity** with multiple antennas at the receiver using **Alamouti coding**.
  - Assessed the performance of the Alamouti scheme in terms of error probability under **BPSK, QPSK** and **16-QAM** modulation.


## Computer Assignment 3

- Part 1
  - Simulated an **OFDM** system over a multipath **frequency-selective** channel.
  - Implemented **waterfilling** power allocation across subcarriers.
  - Implemented **ZF (Zero Forcing)** and **MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error)** equalization at the receiver, comparing their performance based on BER.
  - Investigated the effect of **clipping**.
