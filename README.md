## Presentation
As part of my wireless communications course, I carefully read and presented the paper [Clustering-Based Activity Detection Algorithms for Grant-Free Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9507457) by **Emil Bj√∂rnson**, **Erik G. Larsson**, and **Unnikrishnan Kunnath Ganesan**. You can find my presentation slides [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGKZoX9lE4/4sRfkjlM8lVUDxmPJczWkA/view?utm_content=DAGKZoX9lE4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).
