# Wireless-Communications
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Wireless Communications course assignments, including computer assignments and the final presentation.

## Computer Assignment 1
- Part 1
  - Modeled and analyzed **path loss** and **shadowing** effects on received signal power.
  - Evaluated **SNR** variations with distance and environmental factors.
  - Assessed **outage probability** in a cellular network.
  - Compared theoretical and simulated **network coverage areas**.

- Part 2
  - Simulated **Rayleigh fading channels** with multipath propagation.
  - Examined **channel frequency response** over a specified bandwidth.

- Part 3
  - Computed and analyzed **average** and **RMS delay spread** in a given **power delay profile(PDP)**.

- Part 4
  - Implemented **Gradient Ascent** for optimal **power allocation** in multi-user networks.
  - Evaluated **SINR** and its impact on network performance.


## Computer Assignment 2

- Part 1
  - Simulated **Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC)** for a receiver with varying branches in a **Rayleigh fading** environment.
  - Plotted **Bit Error Rate (BER)** versus SNR for different branch numbers in **16-QAM** modulation.

- Part 2
  - Implemented **time diversity** by repeating symbols across multiple time slots.
  - Evaluated optimal **decision-making** for **BPSK** modulated symbols in terms of SNR.

- Part 3
  - Simulated **space diversity** with multiple antennas at the receiver using **Alamouti coding**.
  - Assessed the performance of the Alamouti scheme in terms of error probability under BPSK modulation.
  - Extended analysis to QPSK and 16-QAM modulations and compared the outcomes.


## Computer Assignment 3

- Part 1
  - Simulated an OFDM system over a multipath frequency-selective channel.
  - Designed and analyzed system parameters, including cyclic prefix and number of subcarriers, considering the coherence time and delay spread of the channel.
  - Implemented waterfilling power allocation across subcarriers and evaluated its impact on system performance.
  - Simulated and compared Bit Error Rate (BER) vs SNR for different power allocation schemes, including waterfilling and uniform power allocation.

- Part 2
  - Applied Zero Forcing (ZF) and MMSE equalization at the receiver to combat the effects of multipath fading.
  - Simulated and compared BER performance under both equalization schemes.

- Part 3
  - Modeled the effect of clipping in an OFDM system and evaluated its impact on the BER.
  - Analyzed the trade-off between power efficiency and distortion using clipping and simulated results for MMSE
